# Clean Code Challenge

Welcome to the Clean Code Challenge! This task is designed to help you practice refactoring and organizing messy code in JavaScript, following clean code principles. You will be provided with examples of poorly written, messy, or spaghetti code, and your objective is to clean up the code and apply clean code principles to make it more readable, maintainable, and following best practices for clean code in JavaScript.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository by clicking on the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the page
   
2. Clone the repository to your local machine by running git clone <repository-url> in your terminal. Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository.
   
3. Navigate to the cloned repository using the cd command in your terminal. This should be the folder that contains the `messyCode.js` file.

4. Review the provided JavaScript code in the `messyCode.js` file, which contains six examples of code that can be improved following clean code principles.

5. Refactor the code to make it more readable, maintainable, and following clean code principles. You can use techniques such as breaking down complex logic into smaller functions, using meaningful variable and function names, adding comments to explain the code, and improving formatting and indentation.

6. After refactoring the code, explain the changes you made and the clean code principles you applied in a brief write-up or comments in the code itself.

7. Test your refactored code with different inputs to make sure it produces the correct output and behaves as expected.

8. Bonus: If you have time, you can further improve the code by optimizing performance, removing unnecessary code, or applying additional best practices for clean code in JavaScript.

## Submission

After completing the task, please follow the instructions below to submit your work:

1. Run git add . in your terminal to track the changes
2. Run git commit -m "" to stage the changes
3. Run git push to push the changes to your forked repository
4. Create a pull request to submit your work for review

## Examples

The `messyCode.js` file contains three examples of poorly written code:

1. Messy Code: A series of nested functions with unclear names and formatting issues.
2. Spaghetti Code: A function with a complex loop that can be simplified and improved.
3. Poorly Written Code: A series of variable declarations with unclear formatting.
4. Deeply Nested Conditionals: A function with deeply nested conditionals that can be simplified.
5. Long Function with Multiple Responsibilities: A function with multiple responsibilities that can be refactored.
6. Duplicate Code: A function with duplicated code that can be eliminated.

Your task is to refactor these examples to follow clean code principles, such as proper indentation, meaningful variable and function names, appropriate comments, and modularization.
